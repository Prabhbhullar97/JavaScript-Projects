# JavaScript-Projects

This repository contains my coding projects and assignments from the JavaScript course.  
It will include practice exercises, challenges, and mini-projects that demonstrate my progress as I learn JavaScript.  

I will regularly update this repository with new code, which will also serve as part of my coding portfolio.
